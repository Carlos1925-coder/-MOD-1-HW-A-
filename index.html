    <h1>File and Folder Management - Review</h1>
  <p>Page 1 is working correctly</p>
  <p>Page 2 is not working properly, to fix this problem based on the image I see showing the structure of files and folders of those pages in my Hills account. To correct the problem, we will have to fix the file path route, by adding the pages folder before the page2.html in the file path. Updated code should look like this "https://hills.ccsf.edu/~cdasilva/cnit132/pages/page2.html".</p>
    <p>Page 3 is not working, in the example, the file path seems 90% correct but the problem is a case-sensitive misspelling. To fix the issue or bug we will have to update the file path to look like this "https://hills.ccsf.edu/~cdasilva/cnit132/page3.html".</p>
